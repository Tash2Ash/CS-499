 # REFINEMENT PLAN

## Software Design/Engineering

For the first portion of the ePortfolio assignment I have chosen to use the mongoDB and Python files from CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts.  This project involved creating a database within mongoDB containing documents that were used to create an interface to display data for use by a companyâ€™s employees.  To further enhance this portion of the project, I plan to create a database within mongoDB using JavaScript instead of Python through Node.js in VS Code.  I will begin by accessing Mongo through a terminal in VS Code and creating the database and importing the JSON file containing the data.   This portion of the ePortfolio will display the ability to work with different coding languages and use different software design structures to achieve the same results. 
  
## Algorithms and Data Structure

The second portion of the ePortfolio will also be taken from CS 340 Advance Programming Concepts continuing work with a Mongo database.  Using the structure and database created in the first portion to build off, I will then create CRUD functionality to manage documents within the database using Node.js.  The purpose of this enhancement will be to showcase more complexity to the simple CRUD functions created in CS 340 including a way to filter the data.  

## Databases

The final portion of the ePortfolio will be a continuation of the skills demonstrated in the first two portion of the project using assignments from CS 340.  The original assignment used Jupyter Notebook to create an interface that allowed users to view and manipulate the data within the Mongo database.  Instead of using Jupyter Notebook I will be using Node.js and Express to create a web application that will work with the Mongo database documents.  This enhancement will include the use of HTML/CSS to create a more aesthetically pleasing interface than previously used in Jupyter.  

## ePortfolio Summary

With the enhancements proposed above I hope to illustrate skills I have learned throughout the program and develop a web application from start to finish.  The enhancements begin with the creation of a database, functionality to modify the repository as needed, and the ability to view and interact with the data using a web application.  The narrative will include a walkthrough of the process, that includes explanations as to each approach, and any thoughts for future improvements to the code and anything that I would like to explore further.  For the overall professional assessment, I hope to showcase my ability when given data to create an environment that can provide a functional application of the data.  With each portion of the project, I hope to uncover any aspects of development that I need to research and work more on to become proficient and use in the future professionally.


# CODE REVIEW

In this [Video] (https://youtu.be/fJVIL6loSF4) I review the previous project and summarize my plans for enhancements described above.
